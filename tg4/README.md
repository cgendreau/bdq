<h1>Welcome to the Vocabularies of Values Task Group</h1>

## Charter 
-    [Task Group 4 - Best practices for development of vocabularies of values ("Vocabularies")](https://www.tdwg.org/community/bdq/tg-4/)


<h2>Goals, outputs and outcomes</h2>
Goals, outputs and outcomes
1. Preparation of a Scoping Document. The document will include the following topics: - Determining what types of vocabularies would be needed for TDWG â€“ consistent with the various ISO Standards on Vocabularies (i.e., do we require vocabularies, dictionaries of terms, controlled vocabularies, thesauri, ontologies, etc.), and whether vocabularies should be mono-lingual or multi-lingual. - Determining a strategy for organizing the construction of vocabularies, considering: A) structuring of work within TDWG, with the following options: 1) the creation of a separate Interest group; 2) the creation of several Task Groups within the Data Quality Interest Group, or associated to other TDWG Interest Groups; B) Domain specific needs and practices.

2. Development of a common repository for TDWG vocabularies-of-values. GitHub will be the first option but other alternatives will be explored to provide a user-friendly platform for gathering and developing vocabularies. Exploration of alternative platform is expected.

3. Development of a current best practice for the building of TDWG vocabularies. Such format will be based primarily on the TDWG Standards Documentation Specification.

4. Building of at least one exemplary vocabulary under the standard format developed in item 3.

5. Collection and assessment of already existing vocabularies across the community that can be used as are, or that can be modified for TDWG purposes. The list of such vocabularies will be made available through the common repository.

6. Identification of domain-specific groups that may be involved in the preparation of vocabularies and creation of a list of contacts that will be available through the GitHub repository.

7. In-depth evaluation of the current state of data that is shared through aggregators in relation to the use of controlled values for each Darwin Core term. A report will be built.

8. Preparation of a list of vocabularies needed for terms of the Darwin Core standard based on the previous report.
