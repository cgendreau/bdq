## 1 Introduction (non-normitive)

This document includes terms that are part of the BDQ Core vocabulary (<http://rs.tdwg.org/version/dwc/{ratification_date}>). The document includes terms in two namespaces that contain the recommended terms: `bdq:` and `bdqffdq:`.

For a simplied list of current terms, see the BDQ Core Quick Reference Guide {http://..........}.

Sections 1 and 3 are non-normative.

Section 2 is normative.

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI` and `Definition` are normative. The values of `Term Name` `skos:pref:Label` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties (such as `Examples` and `Notes`) are non-normative.
