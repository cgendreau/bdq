## 1 Introduction (non-normitive)

This document includes the tests that are used to test for biodiversity data quality. The document includes terms in three namespaces that contain the recommended terms: `bdq:`, `bdqffdq:` and `bdq:core`. For details and rationale, see Chapman AD, Belbin L, Zermoglio PF, Wieczorek J, Morris PJ, Nicholls M, Rees ER, Veiga AK, Thompson A, Saraiva AM, James SA, Gendreau C, Benson A, Schigel D (2020). Developing Standards for Improved Data Quality and for Selecting Fit for Use Biodiversity Data. Biodiversity Information Science and Standards 4: e50889. https://doi.org/10.3897/biss.4.50889.

For a simplied list of current terms, see the BDQ Core Quick Reference Guide {http://..........}.

Sections 1 and 3 are non-normative.

Section 2 is normative.

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI` and `Definition` are normative. The values of `Term Name` `skos:pref:Label` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties (such as `Examples` and `Notes`) are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) [\[RFC 2119\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and [\[RFC 8174\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.3 Namespace abbreviations

The following namespace abbreviations are used in this document:

| Prefix | IRI |
| --- | --- |
| bdq: | http://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/terms/ |
| bbqffdq: | http://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/bdqffdq/ |
| bbdcore: | http://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/bdqcore/ |

## 2 Use of Terms
Due to the requirements of [bdqffdq](https://rs.tdwg.org/bdqffdq/terms), controlled value strings MUST be used as values of the `bdqffdq:` namespace.
Due to the requirements of [bdq](https://rs.tdwg.org/bdq/terms), controlled value strings MUST be used as values of the `bdq:` namespace.
Due to the requirements of [bdq](https://rs.tdwg.org/bdqcore/terms), controlled value strings MUST be used as values of the `bdqcore:` namespace.
