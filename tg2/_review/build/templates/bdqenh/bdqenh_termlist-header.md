## 1 Introduction
This document includes terms intended to be used as a controlled value for BDQ Core tests with local name `Enhancement`.  For details and rationale, see Veiga AK, Saraiva AM, Chapman AD, Morris PJ, Gendreau C, Schigel D, & Robertson TJ (2017). A conceptual framework for quality assessment and management of biodiversity data. PLOS ONE 12 (6): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178731>

### 1.1 Data Quality Criteria

The scope of the standard is the fundamental information about core tests of type bdqffdq:Amendment. The Enhancement describes, in abstract terms, how proposals can modify data to improve fitness.  An enhancement expresses in general terms what a bdqffdq:Specification expresses in specific terms.   Enhancements have an informal relationship to bdqffdq:Dimensions, expressed here in the comments, these relationships could be formalized, but we have not done so.

| term_localName |definition | comments | 
| ------------------ |----------- | ------------- | 
| AssumedDefault |Data could be improved by setting an empty value to a default value | Data in a bdqffdq:InformationElement are absent and may be proposed to be filled in with a default value.  Corresponding dimension is bdqdim:Completeness | 
| Converted |Data could be improved by converting from one representation to another | As in spatial coordinate transformations.  Data in a bdqffdq:InformationElement that do not conform to some specification may be proposed to be replaced in with a conforming value.  Corresponding dimension is bdqdim:Conformance | 
| FillInFrom |Data could be improved by using one data value to fill in the empty value in another | As in filling in from verbatim terms.  Data in a bdqffdq:InformationElement are absent and may be proposed to be filled in by interpretation of values in one or more other terms.  Corresponding dimension is bdqdim:Completeness. | 
| Standardized |Data could be improved by conforming them to a standard representation. | Data in a bdqffdq:InformationElement that do not conform to some format, syntax, data type, or standard may be proposed to be replaced in with a conforming value.  Corresponding dimension is bdqdim:Conformance | 
| Transposed |Data could be improved by switching values between two or more fields. | Data in a set of at least two bdqffdq:InformationElements that do not conform to expectations may be proposed to have their values switched in order to produce conforming values.  Corresponding dimension is bdqdim:Consistency. |

## 1.3 Use of Terms

Due to the requirements of [bdqffdq](https://rs.tdwg.org/bdqffdq/terms), controlled values from this vocabulary are REQUIRED values of `bdqffdq:Enhancement`.

### 2 Status of the content of this document

In Section 1.2 the values of the `Term IRI`, `Definition` and `Controlled value` are normative. The values of `Term Name`, 'Comments' and `skos:prefLabel` are non-normative. 

### 2.1 RFC 2119 key words
