# 1. Introduction

This page lists the BDQ Core tests by terms defined below. Definitions, comments, and examples may include namespace abbreviations (e.g., “dwc:”). These are included to show that the meaning for the word it is attached to, specifically means the term as defined in that namespace. Thus, dwc:Event means Event as defined by Darwin Core at https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#event.

This page is a descriptive document, not the full vocabulary definition document for bdqcore: terms.  This page combines the normative test names and terms with non-normative comments and examples that are meant to help people to use the tests confidently and consistently.  Definitions, comments, and examples include namespace abbreviations (e.g., “bdq:”, “dwc:”). These abbreviations are included to show that the meaning for the term it is attached to specifically means the term as defined in that namespace. Thus, bdq:Empty means that the value of the term "Empty" specifically as defined within the bdq: namespace.
