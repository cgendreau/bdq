<!--- Note: This document deliberately diverges from many of the SHOULD expecations of section 3.2.3 Layout and style of the SDS for the express purpose of simplicity.  Some header values have been included in the first paragraph of text, others have been omitted, a table of contents has been omitted, the introduction and abstract are combined, the introduction is not given a heading, and, in consequence, headings are not numbered. --->

This document is intended to be an easy-to-read reference (as of {doc_modified}) of the bdqffdq ontology, which provides a framework for describing data quality.  The bdqffdq ontology is maintained as part of the TDWG standard [BDQ Core]({standard_iri}) produced by the {creator} and is maintained by the {maintainer}. This document lists the terms in the bdqffdq: namespace below. Definitions, comments, and examples may include namespace abbreviations (e.g., "bdq:", “bdffdq:”). These are reequired as the meaning for the word is defined specifically in that namespace.

The quick reference guide to the BDQ Core tests described with the bdqffdq: ontology can be found at [Terms in bdqcore: Quick Reference Guide](../bdqcore/index.md). 

This page is a descriptive document, not the full vocabulary definition document for bdqffdq: terms.   It combines a subset of the normative and non-normative elements of classes and properties found in the [full bdqffdq: ontology](../../vocabulary/bdqffdq.owl), and does not include additional elements such as domains and restrictions found therein. 
Further details are in the overview at [BDQ Core Introduction](../../intro/index.md), and in the [bdqffdq Framework Users Guide](../../guide/bdqffdq/index.md).

If you have questions or suggestions, submit these to the [BDQ Core Issues](https://github.com/tdwg/bdq/issues) page in GitHub. See the bottom of this document for how to cite BDQ Core.

A diagram showing the intended relationships of the main classes and data properties is below, for more diagrams and explanation of the ontology see the [bdqffdq Framework Users Guide](../../guide/bdqffdq/index.md).
