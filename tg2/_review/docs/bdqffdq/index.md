**Abstract**: The BDQ Conceptual Framework ontology formally describes the terms and relationships between them for evaluating the quality of biodiversity data. Due to the comprehensiveness of the conceptual framework, it allows different interpretations and manners of using it according to different stakeholders. The Framework also provides a base for the bdq: and bdqcore: namespace vocabularies.

### 1.1 Framework for describing data quality (Paul) (Informative)
Included in this standard is a specification for a framework for describing data quality. Each of the tests in this standard has been designed within this framework and is framed using the terms and concepts from the framework. The framework provides the context for each test, and has shaped decisions made about each test.

The framework data quality with respect to some specified use.  It provides a means to describe a use of data, and what is needed for some data set to have quality for that use, that is for some data set to be fit for a specified purpose.  The framework explicitly links data quality to use, and allows formal description of means to assure that data are fit for some specified purpose.  

* Data Quality Control, Data Quality Assurance.

The framework draws a distinction between Quality Control and Quality Assurance.  Quality Control processes seek to assess the quality of data for some purpose, then identify changes to the data or to processes around the data for improving the quality of the data. Quality Assurance processes seek to filter some set of data to a subset that is fit for some purpose, that is to assure that data used for some purpose are fit for that purpose.

* Data Quality Needs, Data Quality Mechanisms, Data Quality Reports.

The framework organizes data quality concepts into three areas: Needs, Mechanisms, and Reports. Data Quality Needs identify a use to which data may be put, and frame a set of requirements that data needs to meet to be fit for that use, and means by which data not fit for that use may be improved.  The tests described in this standard are formal descriptions of data quality needs for CORE purposes.  Data Quality Mechanisms in the framework are formal descriptions of software and other mechanisms that implement tests described in the Needs area.  Data Quality Reports are the results produced by Mechanisms on some set of data.  The tests described in this standard include specifications of assertions to be made in Data Quality Reports.

* Horizontal: Needs, Reports, Vertical: Test informal, describes both need and reporting.

The framework defines four central descriptors of data quality needs: Amendments, Measures, Validations, and Issues.

Amendments propose changes to data or processes that, if accepted, may improve the fitness of data for a specific use.

Measures measure some specific aspect of data quality.

Validations assess compliance with a need.  Data have quality if they are compliant with the requirements of the validation test.  Validations relate information elements and resource types with a specification of specifically how to assess fitness of the data under some narrow criterion, and themselves are assembled into validations policies, which are linked to other policies to cover a description of the data quality needs of a UseCase.

![Diagram of the classes involved in expressing data quality needs with Validations.](bdqffdq_data_quality_needs.svg "Expressing data quality needs: Validations")

Issues are the converse of Validations.  Data lack quality if an issue identifies a potential problem in the data that would require further human review to identify if the data have quality for some purpose.  

The framework has an abstract concept of Information Elements. To frame tests on Darwin Core terms in a usable way, we list specific Darwin Core terms as the information elements in each test.

Formally, in the Data Quality Needs level, the framework starts with a Use Case, a framing of some use to which data may be put.  Use cases are related to the formal description of data quality needs through policies and contexts.  Contexts (ContextualizedCriterion, ContextualizedDimension, ContextualizedEnhancement, ContextualizedIssue) relate the specification of a need, such as a Validation, to the information elements that need to be examined, and to the resource type that is operated on.  Each of the tests described in this standard has a formal specification that includes each of these elements.   A Use Case includes a set of policies, policies relate the use case to contexts, contexts link information elements to needs and to resource types, a need specify what properties data must have to have quality.   

Data quality needs can relate to the data quality of single records (bdqffdq:SingleRecord) or of data sets (bdqffdq:MultiRecord).
