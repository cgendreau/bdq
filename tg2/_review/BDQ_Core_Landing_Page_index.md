# BDQ Core

{:.lead}
BDQ Core is a standard maintained by the [BDQ Core Maintenance Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/bdq/#maintenance-group">). BDQ Core is based on a Data Quality Framework [Framework]. It includes a suite of tests and related vocabularies intended to **facilitate the evaluation of the 'quality' or 'fitness for use' of biodiversity data that uses the [Darwin Core standard] (https://dwc.tdwg.org/)**. BDQ Core is not a specification of the quality to which biodiversity data are expected to conform.
