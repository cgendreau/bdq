This directory contains place holders, with proposed header lines, for append only term version files from which other derivatives would be created.

These would form the basis of maintinance for an approved standard, but code has not been written yet to create derivatives from these files.  

For the bdq and bdqdim vocabularies, code from Darwin Core can be reused.  For bdqffdq (owl) and bdqcore (rdf using bdqffdq), new code will likely be needed.
