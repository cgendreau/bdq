The _term.csv files in this directory are copied from elsewhere.  
** DO NOT EDIT ** them in place here.  Edit their master copies elsewhere in the tdwg/bdq/ tree and copy updates of them to here.

The term_version directory contains stubs for term_version.csv files that would form the basis for maintinance for these vocabularies, but are not being produced as part of the submission for consideration of the standard.
