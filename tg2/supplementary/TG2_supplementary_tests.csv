This bdq:Supplementary test is not regarded as CORE (cf. bdq:CORE) because of one or more of the reasons: not being widely applicable; not informative; not straightforward to implement or likely to return a high percentage of either bdq:COMPLIANT or bdq:NOT_COMPLIANT results (cf bdq:Response.result). A Supplementary test may be implemented as CORE when a suitable use case exists.","closed","TG2 Validation NAME Test Supplementary Conformance Parameterized"

This change derived from a discussion at TDWG 2023 on the use of dwc:taxonID and dwc:scientificNameID. It was concluded that a test VALIDATION_SCIENTIFICNAMEID was justified as CORE while this test should be SUPPLEMENTARY.  The original test ""VALIDATION_TAXONID_AMBIGUOUS"" was seen by the TG2 team as too complex to implement. If we use any single bdq:sourceAuthority such as GBIF, a valid and complete dwc:taxonID based on an alternative source authority is unlikely to provide a valid match. A text or number string as a namespace indicator without a URI will be ambiguous. As an example, GBIF's backbone taxonomy dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.15468/39omei. When referencing a GBIF taxon by GBIF's identifier for that taxon, use the the pseudo-namespace ""gbif:"" and the form ""gbif:{integer}"" as the value for dwc:taxonID.","closed","TG2 Validation NAME Test Supplementary Conformance"
