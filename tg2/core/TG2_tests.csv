A match on any of those names should constitute a consistency, and dwc:countryCode should not be needed to make this determination, that is, this test does not attempt to disambiguate potential duplicate first-level administrative division names. The level of buffering may be related to the scale of the underlying GIS layer being used. At a global scale, typical map scales used for borders and coastal areas are either 1:3M or 1:1M (Dooley 2005, Chapter 4). Horizontal accuracy at those scales is around 1.5-2.5km and 0.5-0.85 km respectively (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020).
