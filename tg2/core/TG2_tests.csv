If the dwc:coordinateUncertaintyInMeters is not EMPTY and is valid, this amendment should add to the dwc:coordinateUncertaintyInMeters the uncertainty contributed by the maximum datum shift at the given coordinates. Since different systems have differing requirements for what the default datum should be, it is left unspecified, but should match whatever the target datum is in AMENDMENT_COORDINATES_CONVERTED (620749b9-7d9c-4890-97d2-be3d1cde6da8). After the amendment is performed, the dwc:geodeticDatum field should be the assumed default datum as parameterized. An example implementation to determine the uncertainty added by asserting a default datum (datum shift) where a known datum is not declared can be found in [datumshiftproj.py](https://github.com/VertNet/georefcalculator/blob/master/source/python/datumshiftproj.py) in the source code for the [Georeferencing Calculator](http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html) (Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2021).
